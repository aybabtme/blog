My right Sandal is dead.  I don't know what killed it, and I'm not in a
mood to find the culprit. There's no need for witch hunts, I'm better
than that, better than those who killed my right Sandal.

This Sandal walked in the sand of Dubai, in the dust of Kandahar, on the
roads of Queensland, Australia, on the beach of Paphos, Cyprus, on the
dirt of Sai Gon's roads.  It has
visited the airports of Newark, Chicago, Ottawa, Vancouver, Brisbane,
Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Montreal, Doha, London and many
others.

This Sandal sustained my foot for thousands of kilometers.

Today, this sandal is no more.

The Sandal is dead.  Long live the Sandal.
