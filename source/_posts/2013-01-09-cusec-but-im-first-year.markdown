Some people came to me wondering about the pertinence of [CUSEC][99] for them: they're first year, they don't feel they have anything to sell to recruiters, they don't have much confidence in their skills.

> Is it worth it for me to attend CUSEC?  I'm first year, I'll never get a job!

If you're in that situation: CUSEC is just what you need.

<!-- more -->

CUSEC is much more than a career fair.  The career fair is actually just a part of the conference, the main focus being on the keynotes, the talks, the workshops and the group activities. If you have to expect something from CUSEC, it should be that your brain will be filled by awesome stuff delivered to you by top notch speakers.

If you don't feel confident in your skill, you don't really have a feel of what's this industry is all about, what's the job(s) like, how to be relevant and employable: CUSEC is exactly the spark that will lead you to an understanding of what's going on.  You might be wandering on campus, walking from classes to classes and thinking.

> That's all great stuff, but where is this soft. eng./comp. sci. course going, what's its purpose in my career dreams?

CUSEC will be that window onto your future.  Now, I'm not going to pretend I know better than anyone else, because I don't.  I'm second year, I'll have my first COOP term this Summer (Amazon-look-at-me-I'm-coming!!!), I'm a super big newb in this.  But I feel I know a bit more than I did last year, I have a feeling of where I'm going and how to play my cards. So, here's my little testimony about why CUSEC is relevant to first years, very much so.

## Last year, I was first year and it was my first time at CUSEC.  

When I first heard about CUSEC, it was on an email I received in November.  Before that I saw posters about the conference, but I'm not the kind of guy who pays attention to posters.  But anyway, when I received this e-mail, I was in a mood of 'doing stuff'.  So, wondering if I should spend the money, I thought to myself

> What do I have to lose going?  Nothing (but a couple of $)

And so I went.  And it was awesome.  But I was first year, I didn't know shit, like nothing at all.  Once there, I realized there was a career fair going on all conference long.  I don't know why but I never paid attention to the HD's message regarding the carrer fairs - my attention span sucks like that. So I was there, in front of all those recruiters in front of impressive, big names and I remember feeling overwhelmed.  

I went up the stairs of the hotel and thrown out a resume in 30 minutes.  Then I went downstair back to the conference floor and started to distribute my resume. God I had no clue what anything was about.  I went to the [Riot Games booth][1] (makers of League of Legend), the guy there asking me

> So do you prefer 'front end' of 'back end' development?

Say what? Dude, I can do 'Hello World' in Java if you want, but I don't understand your Alien Language!

By the end of the conference, I was exposed to a lot of Alien Language!  Awesome, mind blowing keynotes such at [Inventing on Principle][2] by [Bret Victor][5] (incredible talk that created waves around the world - notably inspiring a [Kickstarter][3] by [Chris Granger][4]), tech talks by Dropbox, Coffeescript's creator, Bioware, etc.  Lot of food for my thought.

The first step in understanding a domain is often to get a vocabulary for it.  Once you get the vocabulary, you know what to look for.  You have a name for things.  You can go on Google and find ressources to learn more.  CUSEC gave me an opportunity to see what's going on, what's the game 

The second step in understanding a domain might as well be to get a feel for its community.  Knowing the kind of people forming it, the problems they deal with, the kind of work they do.  See their face, know their name, get them to know you, perhaps, a little bit?  Meet people working in the field you study for.  Learn what they have to say.  There's a lot to gain from that exposure. Hell, you might just meet somebody who'll remember you (!!) when they are looking to hire an intern! 

So what should you do?  Last year, I went there and thought of my 'CUSEC performance' in a _this-is-a-practice-shot_ way.  I went to get a feel of what's the recruiting game about, who are the people forming this industry.  My mission statement was

> Try to suceed,  and be ready for failure.

Failure because, of course, the Riot Games recruiter was not very impressed that I had no clue about any of the words that got out of his mouth.  But it doesn't matter, I got a glimpse at his Alien Language and this year, I can come back and try to speak it.  I'll have a much better shot at it now that I know his secret codes and magical incantations.

Like anything, see it as an iterative process.  I go this year and I try to succeed, althought the chance are low I'll get a job. But whatever, next year my chance will be much better!  If you don't start this year, in first year, you'll be a year late in your 4-year-learning-opportunity.

Going to CUSEC in first year is the best thing you can do.  You'll get tons of leads about the domain.  You'll meet awesome people, make friends with people who care, you'll have a blast with the keynotes, you'll be inspired by the speakers, you'll have a shot at the ways for your future.

So what do you have to lose going?  Please don't have an attitude in the __'is it worth trying'__ style, it leads to nothing.  The only thing preventing you from _doing_ stuff is _you_, when you decide _not to do them_.  So go to CUSEC, see what happens!  Maybe you'll hate it, maybe you'll love it: at least you'll know.

Like Edison said

> I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

So yeah. Go to CUSEC, it's worth it, even if you don't think you'll land a job.  There's so much more than that about CUSEC!
