With [recent news] about exploits in Java web-browser plugins and recommendation to [disable such plugins], here's a very simple trick that will protect you from most simple attacks that can be carried from websites.

Of course that's not nearly enough to secure your computers, but it will surely help by greatly reducing the surface area on which your computer is vulnerable to threats.

## Along with that, common practices are:

* __Not to run unknown executables.__
* Especially __not to run unknown executables with root/administrator privileges__.
* __Not to use pirated software__.
* If you want to __go on shaddy websites, use a virtual machine__.
* If you want to __use pirated software, assume your computer is pirated/infected__ and any password, card number, account number you type - any key you press - is being recorded. Only use this computer to use those pirated software, use a physicaly different machine to do your banking/read your emails, login to any website.

The use of pirated software could be a whole blog post in itself.  Simply put, just figure that inserting instructions of their choice into your lovely pirated game is trivial to crackers producing warez.  Hey, they need to pay their bills too!  Turning your computer to a botnet is an effective way to do so!
