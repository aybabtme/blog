    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You use Gnome 3. You usually have two monitors.  Today, you removed one
(for whatever reason).  You open applications and they are all
offscreen.  You curse, you cry, you think of the worst.  You contemplate
putting an end to your eternal agony.</p>

<p>Fear no more.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Multi-monitor support on Linux generally sucks.  Gnome 3 has many
flaws, people love to bash on it... but personnaly, I think it's getting
better and better.  However, multi-monitor support sucks.</p>

<p>So how can you take that stupid out-of-screen window and put it back
into the Visible World ?</p>

<p><code>Alt-Tab</code> into the off-screen app, then <code>Alt-Space</code> it's window's menu
out of the darkness.  Press <code>m</code> to free it from its constraints and
<code>wiggle-your-mouse-on-the-screen</code> the app back into a more decent
position.</p>

<p>You just saved the day.  Carry on.</p>
