    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was young, I didn't have a car, I worked in a gaz station and it was
Winter.  The last bus coming in my part of town had passed its last run
an hour ago, I was hungry and cold.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So I walked to the closest pizzeria.  I called them and ordered a pizza
to be delivered to my house.</p>

<p>Then I went to the back entrance and asked the delivery guys if they
would accept to deliver me with my pizza, given that I would give them a
decent tip.</p>

<p>So for the price of a pizza and the subsequent tip I would have paid
anyway to the delivery guy, I also got a ride home.  The same ride would
have cost me 15$ of taxi, back then.</p>

<p>So yeah. Hacking life.</p>
