    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My right Sandal is dead.  I don't know what killed it, and I'm not in a
mood to find the culprit. There's no need for witch hunts, I'm better
than that, better than those who killed my right Sandal.</p>

<p><img src="/images/death_of_sandal.jpg" title="A broken sandal." alt="The Dead Sandal"></p>

<p>This Sandal walked in the sand of Dubai, in the dust of Kandahar, on the
roads of Queensland, Australia, on the beach of Paphos, Cyprus, on the
dirt of Sai Gon's roads.  It has
visited the airports of Newark, Chicago, Ottawa, Vancouver, Brisbane,
Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Montreal, Doha, London and many
others.</p>

<p>This Sandal sustained my foot for thousands of kilometers.</p>

<p>Today, this sandal is no more.</p>

<p>The Sandal is dead.  Long live the Sandal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was young, I didn't have a car, I worked in a gaz station and it was
Winter.  The last bus coming in my part of town had passed its last run
an hour ago, I was hungry and cold.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So I walked to the closest pizzeria.  I called them and ordered a pizza
to be delivered to my house.</p>

<p>Then I went to the back entrance and asked the delivery guys if they
would accept to deliver me with my pizza, given that I would give them a
decent tip.</p>

<p>So for the price of a pizza and the subsequent tip I would have paid
anyway to the delivery guy, I also got a ride home.  The same ride would
have cost me 15$ of taxi, back then.</p>

<p>So yeah. Hacking life.</p>
