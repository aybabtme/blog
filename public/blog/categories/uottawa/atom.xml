    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some people came to me wondering about the pertinence of <a href="http://2013.cusec.net/">CUSEC</a> for them: they're first year, they don't feel they have anything to sell to recruiters, they don't have much confidence in their skills.</p>

<blockquote><p>Is it worth it for me to attend CUSEC?  I'm first year, I'll never get a job!</p></blockquote>

<p>If you're in that situation: CUSEC is just what you need.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>CUSEC is much more than a career fair.  The career fair is actually just a part of the conference, the main focus being on the keynotes, the talks, the workshops and the group activities. If you have to expect something from CUSEC, it should be that your brain will be filled by awesome stuff delivered to you by top notch speakers.</p>

<p>If you don't feel confident in your skill, you don't really have a feel of what's this industry is all about, what's the job(s) like, how to be relevant and employable: CUSEC is exactly the spark that will lead you to an understanding of what's going on.  You might be wandering on campus, walking from classes to classes and thinking.</p>

<blockquote><p>That's all great stuff, but where is this soft. eng./comp. sci. course going, what's its purpose in my career dreams?</p></blockquote>

<p>CUSEC will be that window onto your future.  Now, I'm not going to pretend I know better than anyone else, because I don't.  I'm second year, I'll have my first COOP term this Summer (Amazon-look-at-me-I'm-coming!!!), I'm a super big newb in this.  But I feel I know a bit more than I did last year, I have a feeling of where I'm going and how to play my cards. So, here's my little testimony about why CUSEC is relevant to first years, very much so.</p>

<h2>Last year, I was first year and it was my first time at CUSEC.</h2>

<p>When I first heard about CUSEC, it was on an email I received in November.  Before that I saw posters about the conference, but I'm not the kind of guy who pays attention to posters.  But anyway, when I received this e-mail, I was in a mood of 'doing stuff'.  So, wondering if I should spend the money, I thought to myself</p>

<blockquote><p>What do I have to lose going?  Nothing (but a couple of $)</p></blockquote>

<p>And so I went.  And it was awesome.  But I was first year, I didn't know shit, like nothing at all.  Once there, I realized there was a career fair going on all conference long.  I don't know why but I never paid attention to the HD's message regarding the career fairs - my attention span sucks like that. So I was there, in front of all those recruiters in front of impressive, big names and I remember feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I went up the stairs of the hotel and thrown out a resume in 30 minutes.  Then I went downstair back to the conference floor and started to distribute my resume. God I had no clue what anything was about.  I went to the <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/">Riot Games booth</a> (makers of League of Legend), the guy there asking me</p>

<blockquote><p>So do you prefer 'front end' of 'back end' development?</p></blockquote>

<p>Say what? Dude, I can do 'Hello World' in Java if you want, but I don't understand your Alien Language!</p>

<p>By the end of the conference, I was exposed to a lot of Alien Language!  Awesome, mind blowing keynotes such at <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a> by <a href="http://www.worrydream.com">Bret Victor</a> (incredible talk that created waves around the world - notably inspiring a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table">Kickstarter</a> by <a href="http://www.chris-granger.com/">Chris Granger</a>), tech talks by Dropbox, Coffeescript's creator, Bioware, etc.  Lot of food for my thought.</p>

<p>The first step in understanding a domain is often to get a vocabulary for it.  Once you get the vocabulary, you know what to look for.  You have a name for things.  You can go on Google and find ressources to learn more.  CUSEC gave me an opportunity to see what's going on, what's the game</p>

<p>The second step in understanding a domain might as well be to get a feel for its community.  Knowing the kind of people forming it, the problems they deal with, the kind of work they do.  See their face, know their name, get them to know you, perhaps, a little bit?  Meet people working in the field you study for.  Learn what they have to say.  There's a lot to gain from that exposure. Hell, you might just meet somebody who'll remember you (!!) when they are looking to hire an intern!</p>

<p>So what should you do?  Last year, I went there and thought of my 'CUSEC performance' in a <em>this-is-a-practice-shot</em> way.  I went to get a feel of what's the recruiting game about, who are the people forming this industry.  My mission statement was</p>

<blockquote><p>Try to suceed,  and be ready for failure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Failure because, of course, the Riot Games recruiter was not very impressed that I had no clue about any of the words that got out of his mouth.  But it doesn't matter, I got a glimpse at his Alien Language and this year, I can come back and try to speak it.  I'll have a much better shot at it now that I know his secret codes and magical incantations.</p>

<p>Like anything, see it as an iterative process.  I go this year and I try to succeed, although the chance are low I'll get a job. But whatever, next year my chance will be much better!  If you don't start this year, in first year, you'll be a year late in your 4-year-learning-opportunity.</p>

<p>Going to CUSEC in first year is the best thing you can do.  You'll get tons of leads about the domain.  You'll meet awesome people, make friends with people who care, you'll have a blast with the keynotes, you'll be inspired by the speakers, you'll have a shot at the ways for your future.</p>

<p>So what do you have to lose going?  Please don't have an attitude in the <strong>'is it worth trying'</strong> style, it leads to nothing.  The only thing preventing you from <em>doing</em> stuff is <em>you</em>, when you decide <em>not to do them</em>.  So go to CUSEC, see what happens!  Maybe you'll hate it, maybe you'll love it: at least you'll know.</p>

<p>Like Edison said</p>

<blockquote><p>I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.</p></blockquote>

<p>So yeah. Go to CUSEC, it's worth it, even if you don't think you'll land a job.  There's so much more than that about CUSEC!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello people.</p>

<p>As you may know, I'm Antoine Grondin and I'm taking care of bringing a
bunch of people to CUSEC this year.  As you may also know, today was the
last day to get your ticket and be eligible for up to 100%
reimbursement.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you didn't get your ticket at this time, fear no more.  I'll try to
get more funding this Winter (I applied for the Fall's funding round,
I'll apply again for the Winter round).</p>

<p>In the mean time, here are some numbers about our delegation, as it is
right NOW (the graphs are interactive, so they'll update as we go
forward in the time continuum - or are we going <em>forward</em>?? dun dun
dun).</p>

<blockquote><p>GRAPHS !!!1!!ONE</p></blockquote>

<p>Whoooo, before I let you loose with the graphs, a few updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>We broke the 39 limit!  DON'T WORRY! I'll apply for funding again this
Winter (I'm repeating myself). Also, I'll confirm the numbers tomorrow
when I get to catch everybody's registration sheet at the IEEE office.</li>
<li>This will be the biggest delegation uOttawa sent to CUSEC.  At least
as far as I've managed to count back.</li>
<li>We're (at the time of writing) way ahead of Waterloo (2nd), and way ahead of
all the other Universities as well. Whatever it might be worth!</li>
<li>Get your résumé ready for CUSEC!  You should look up the sponsors at
<a href="http://2013.cusec.net/">CUSEC.net</a> and look up their "Career" or "Job" page.  You'll find what kind of
jobs/internships they offer, and you won't look like a moron when you
get to their booth with your résumé.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'll try to elaborate more on the résumé thing before we get off.</p>

<h2>A pie made of engineering students, and one random physics/math dude</h2>

<p>This is pretty straight forward, how many people from each program are
coming:</p>

<h2>A pie made of diversityyyy</h2>

<p>Please note that our delegation is, as far as I know, the one that has the
greatest ratio of female/male.  This is pretty good.</p>

<h2>A timeline of the registrations</h2>

<p>We can see that student have an incontrollable tendency to get
registrated in exponential manner.</p>

<p>We could say something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>A first person is registered (1)</li>
<li>This person convinced another student (2)</li>
<li>Who convinced two other students (4)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Etc, everybody convinces at least one other person, and then we grow as
2<sup>n.</sup></li>
</ul>


<p>But the truth is most likely that we're all lazy, greedy and didn't want
to put the money in until the very last few days.</p>
