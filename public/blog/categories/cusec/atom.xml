    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello people.</p>

<p>As you may know, I'm Antoine Grondin and I'm taking care of bringing a
bunch of people to CUSEC this year.  As you may also know, today was the
last day to get your ticket and be eligible for up to 100%
reimbursement.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you didn't get your ticket at this time, fear no more.  I'll try to
get more funding this Winter (I applied for the Fall's funding round,
I'll apply again for the Winter round).</p>

<p>In the mean time, here are some numbers about our delegation, as it is
right NOW (the graphs are interactive, so they'll update as we go
forward in the time continuum - or are we going <em>forward</em>?? dun dun
dun).</p>

<blockquote><p>GRAPHS !!!1!!ONE</p></blockquote>

<p>Whoooo, before I let you loose with the graphs, a few updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>We broke the 39 limit!  DON'T WORRY! I'll apply for funding again this
Winter (I'm repeating myself). Also, I'll confirm the numbers tomorrow
when I get to catch everybody's registration sheet at the IEEE office.</li>
<li>This will be the biggest delegation uOttawa sent to CUSEC.  At least
as far as I've managed to count back.</li>
<li>We're (at the time of writing) way ahead of Waterloo (2nd), and way ahead of
all the other Universities as well. Whatever it might be worth!</li>
<li>Get your résumé ready for CUSEC!  You should look up the sponsors at
<a href="http://2013.cusec.net/">CUSEC.net</a> and look up their "Career" or "Job" page.  You'll find what kind of
jobs/internships they offer, and you won't look like a moron when you
get to their booth with your résumé.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'll try to elaborate more on the résumé thing before we get off.</p>

<h2>A pie made of engineering students, and one random physics/math dude</h2>

<p>This is pretty straight forward, how many people from each program are
coming:</p>

<h2>A pie made of diversityyyy</h2>

<p>Please note that our delegation is, as far as I know, the one that has the
greatest ratio of female/male.  This is pretty good.</p>

<h2>A timeline of the registrations</h2>

<p>We can see that student have an incontrollable tendency to get
registrated in exponential manner.</p>

<p>We could say something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>A first person is registered (1)</li>
<li>This person convinced another student (2)</li>
<li>Who convinced two other students (4)</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Etc, everybody convinces at least one other person, and then we grow as
2<sup>n.</sup></li>
</ul>


<p>But the truth is most likely that we're all lazy, greedy and didn't want
to put the money in until the very last few days.</p>
