<div class="entry-content"><p>So far three journalists contacted me about our Coding Competition.  I&#8217;m pretty surprised people care about it that much.</p>

<p>Anyway, this week somebody writing for a Carleton newspaper contacted me for an interview.  It happened over email, here are my answers to her questions.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3>Why did you create this event at uOttawa?</h3>

<p>Because there is currently no event of this nature held on the campus.  There are many other kind of events organized by both the ESS (Engineering Student Society) and the IEEE student branch, but those are mostly social events.</p>

<p>For a couple of months I&#8217;ve been ruminating the idea of having one or many hackathons on campus.  As it (used to) stands, aside from homework assignments, class projects and some less-publicized outside events involving programming, there is not much going on to encourage students to code on their own.
 I often hear from friends on other campus where people talk in the corridor about their projects, where they get together to code and develop startup ideas.  I wish to have the same kind of exciting and febrile atmosphere on my campus, and I think holding regular hacking events will help fostering this kind of culture to Software Engineers and Computer Scientists.</p>

<p>So I probed a couple of colleagues to know if others would be interested in a hackathon.  The response was very favourable.  So with other members of the IEEE student branch, we decided to hold such an event.
I read that you had thirty participants. Were more interested, or was that the number of students who signed up?
More were interested, but for this first iteration we wanted to keep the numbers low.  The point was to try a kind of &#8216;minimum viable product&#8217; on a small subset of students and see how the reaction would be, what would work well and what would need to be improved.  For that reason, we did limited promotion, reaching mostly our friends on Facebook and doing some word-to-mouth type of promotion.  Thus if the first event was to be a complete failure, we wouldn&#8217;t have screwed our audience and killed the project in its infancy.</p>

<p>Luckily I think this try-run went pretty well, aside from a few technical problems.</p>

<h3>What did you hope to achieve with the event?</h3>

<p>I wish to instill a desire to code into my colleagues.  While many of them say they would like to do some coding on their own, just as many often ask me how they could get started.</p>

<p>The thing is, we have the chance to work in an industry where the demand is really high for good software engineers and computer scientists.  While the demand is this high, recruiters still have a lot of expectations from candidates.  They expect us to have some (good) experience using collaborative tools, to have coded projects on our own time, to do some open-source development, to know many frameworks, to write good, solid and beautiful code, etc.</p>

<p>I think pretty much everybody knows that this is expected from them, but many don&#8217;t really know how to get started.  This hackathon is an easy way for those students to get started.  They don&#8217;t have to think about a project by themselves, they just come here, get offered some schwag from our sponsor, code all night and have fun.  And then hopefully doing so, they realize how easy it is to actually do some coding on their own, without waiting for an assignment to happen or having a project to write for a prof.</p>

<p>They get to use those collaborative tools, use some frameworks, work with their peers in a friendly competitive theatre, and realize (hopefully) that it&#8217;s fun to do so.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s part of what I hope to achieve with these events.  I want to plant a seed of initiative into students who need it, and spark those who already have it and just need a little helper in getting started.  So it&#8217;s kind of an indoctrination plan, if you wish.  I let them try some stuff and then hopefully they get hooked to it and desire more.</p>

<p>And then, what else?  Well I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m kind of selfish in this whole thing.  My far-pulled plan is to get all my colleagues to get so excited about coding, about doing cool projects and this kind of stuff, that by the time I graduate, everybody be stocked about software development.  And hopefully, that freshly brewed culture will have resonated outside our walls, getting employers across the globe excited about our campus and our students, and thus about me.  And then I&#8217;ll get a super nice job, I&#8217;ll have super-talented contacts from uOttawa in companies around the world, and then maybe we&#8217;ll take over the World.  Or not, but at least we&#8217;ll have a better time out there!  I mean, I&#8217;ll have a better time out there.</p>

<h3>How did students react to the event?</h3>

<p>I think most students reacted positively to the event, but there are some who are sceptic.  I don&#8217;t know why they are sceptic, but some people are just like that; you present them with some cool idea that is a first step for them in the good direction, and they&#8217;re suspicious of you and think that you&#8217;re selling them some insurance scam or something.</p>

<p>For instance, I know of a couple of students I contacted personally about the event, and their reaction was pretty literally &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in these things?&#8221;  Lol what? Believe in what?  I&#8217;m not preaching some religion or pyramidal scheme or anything, just offering them to do some cool activity that will benefit them.  But I guess some people are like that, they feel good in their immobilism and, I don&#8217;t know, distrust other people&#8217;s initiative.</p>

<p>Or some are more rational in their disbelief.  They just think they&#8217;re better off concentrating 100% of their time studying, instead of doing silly things like hackathon.  It&#8217;s their right to think so, although I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re wrong.  Having good grades is great, but most recruiter will tell you they care much less about your grades than about your track record of getting projects done.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not a majority of people.  Most people are very excited about these initiatives and want to participate.</p>

<h3>How did NoteShares come to sponsor the event? Did you contact them or did they reach out to you? What was your reaction to their sponsorship?</h3>

<p><a href="https://noteshares.com/">NoteShares</a>&#8217; CEO is a student from uOttawa, and he caught a glimpse of our talks about the hackathon on Facebook and saw that we were investigating getting sponsors in.  So he asked me if he could sponsor our event, and that was pretty great.  He provided us with prizes for the winners, energy drinks for competitors and schwag.</p>

<h3>Do you plan to have similar events in the future? If so, how often and how many people?</h3>

<p>I do plan on having similar events in the future.  I wish to hold these hackathons every month or so, to really give a recurrent and persistent motivator for students to improve themselves on their own.</p>

<p>The monthly hackathons would build up to a bigger hackathon sometime during the year.  In fact I&#8217;m kind of inspired by the <a href="https://www.battlecode.org/">Battlecode</a> initiative at MIT, where people prepare and work on an AI for some time before a big competition where they finally gather to get their code to compete against other teams.</p>

<p>As for the number of people, I want to make it as open as possible.  As much as I can house in the space I&#8217;ll be able to get from the University.  So far the Faculty is very supportive of the initiative, so I think we have plenty of room to scale up the size of the hackathon.  Hopefully their support will remain!</p>
